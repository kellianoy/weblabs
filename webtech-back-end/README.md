### About the folder

In this folder, you will find a simple NodeJs / ExpressJs project with three routes that prints all channels from a data structure.
Our website will be called typetrack.

We have :

1. The main ```/``` route that leads to the presentation of the website.
2. The channels branch ```/channels``` that leads to the list of all channels.
3. The id branch ```/channel/id``` that leads to a specific channel information.
